# SOP-002: Solder Paste Application and Component Placement

## 1. Purpose
Outline the process for applying solder paste consistently using a stencil and manually placing components in a controlled sequence to minimize alignment errors and rework risk.

## 2. Scope
Applies to Proto Core PCB assembly using a paste-stencil and manual component placement

## 3. Tools and Materials
- PCB stencil and 3D-printed alignment jig
- Squeegee/spreader
- Solder paste (record type and lot)
- ESD-safe tweezers
- Microscope
- IPA and lint-free wipes/swabs

## 4. Procedure

### 4.1 Paste Preparation
1. Verify solder paste is within usable working time.
2. Mix paste gently as needed.
3. Deposit solder paste directly onto the squeegee.

### 4.2 Stencil Setup
1. Secure PCB in the stencil jig.
2. Align stencil apertures to PCB pads, prioritizing fine-pitch regions.
3. Ensure stencil is fully supported and cannot shift during printing.

### 4.3 Paste Application
1. Pull a single smooth squeegee stroke across the stencil.
2. Apply consistent pressure and angle.
3. Avoid repeated scrubbing or multiple passes unless required.

### 4.4 Paste Inspection
Inspect paste deposits under microscope.

Verify:
- Clean, centered deposits on fine-pitch pads
- No paste bridges between QFN pads
- Uniform paste dots on BGA footprint
- No missing paste on critical pads

If paste print is unacceptable:
1. Clean PCB and stencil completely with IPA.
2. Allow to dry.
3. Reprint paste.

### 4.5 Component Placement Sequence
Place components in the following order:
1. All non-BGA ICs (MCU, flash, PSRAM, regulators, etc.)
2. Crystals and critical passives
3. Remaining passives by region
4. eMMC BGA last

Placement rules:
- Verify orientation before releasing each component.
- Use ESD tweezers only.
- Minimize contact and disturbance of placed components.
- Avoid touching or repositioning parts after placement.

### 4.6 Pre-Reflow Final Check
1. Inspect entire board under microscope.
2. Confirm all components are placed, aligned, and correctly oriented.
3. Verify eMMC placement alignment and stability.
4. Photograph board in as-placed state (recommended).

## 5. Acceptance Criteria
- Paste is clean with no visible bridging
- All components placed and oriented correctly
- eMMC placed last and undisturbed
- Board cleared for reflow

## 6. Records
- Paste type and lot
- Notes on any paste reprints or placement corrections
- Optional as-placed photos
