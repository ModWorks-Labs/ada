# Hotplate Reflow Procedure – Proto Core

**Process type:** Manual hotplate reflow  
**Applies to:** Proto Core assemblies  
**Measurement method:** Hotplate surface temperature (board temperature inferred via calibration)  
**Revision intent:** Capture proven, repeatable thermal profile without time-sensitive probing risk

---

## 1. Initial Setup
- Hotplate powered on and stable
- K-type thermocouple available
- Thermocouple positioned to measure **hotplate surface temperature**
- Metal cooling surface prepared
- Fan positioned for forced cooling

---

## 2. Preheat / Placement
1. Place populated PCB on hotplate at **20–50 °C**
2. Allow board temperature to equalize briefly
3. Set hotplate target to **150 °C**

**Note:** Board temperature is inferred from calibrated hotplate settings

---

## 3. Soak
1. Monitor **hotplate surface temperature** using K-type thermocouple
2. Once hotplate reaches **~150 °C**, hold for **2–3 minutes**

**Purpose:** Flux activation and thermal equalization  
**Note:** Direct board probing is intentionally avoided to reduce disturbance risk

---

## 4. Reflow Ramp
1. Increase hotplate setpoint to **250 °C**
2. Monitor hotplate surface temperature continuously

**Rationale:** Elevated setpoint compensates for thermal lag and increases ramp rate  
**Note:** Setpoint exceeds solder profile intentionally; board temperature remains within limits

---

## 5. Time Above Liquidus (Inferred)
1. When hotplate surface temperature reaches **~185 °C**, start timer
2. Hold for **~50 seconds**
3. Based on calibration, board temperature will approach but not exceed **~235 °C**

**Note:** Peak board temperature is controlled by timing and removal, not setpoint alone

---

## 6. Board Removal
1. At ~50 seconds above inferred liquidus, carefully remove PCB with tweezers
2. Transfer immediately to prepared metal surface
3. Set down gently without sliding

---

## 7. Cooling
1. Apply fan airflow directly over PCB
2. Cool board to **<40 °C in under 1 minute**
3. Do not disturb components during cooling

---

## 8. Completion
- Reflow complete
- Board ready for cleaning or inspection
