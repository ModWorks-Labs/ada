# SOP-001: Pre-Assembly Inspection

## 1. Purpose
Outline the pre-assembly inspection process for identifying PCB fabrication defects and establish a baseline before solder paste application and component placement.

## 2. Scope
Applies to Proto Core PCBs prior to solder paste application.

## 3. Tools and Materials
- ESD mat
- ESD-safe tweezers
- Microscope (recommended 10×–40× zoom and photo mode)
- DMM (continuity and resistance only)
- IPA and lint-free wipes/swabs

## 4. Procedure

### 4.1 ESD and Handling
1. Verify ESD mat is grounded.
2. Handle PCBs only by edges.

### 4.2 Visual Inspection
Inspect top and bottom of PCB under microscope.

Focus areas:
- MCU QFN region
- eMMC BGA footprint
- Buck/power stage
- RF feedline and antenna keepout

Check for:
- Soldermask encroachment on pads
- Missing or damaged pads
- Unintended copper bridges
- Via-in-pad defects
- Scratches, delamination, or contamination

### 4.3 Cleaning
1. If residue or contamination is present, clean lightly with IPA.
2. Allow PCB to fully dry before proceeding.

### 4.4 Baseline Electrical Sanity
Using DMM:
1. Measure VIN → GND resistance.
2. Measure 3V3 → GND resistance.
3. Measure any other exposed primary rails.

Acceptance guideline:
- .

### 4.5 Documentation
1. Photograph full PCB (top and bottom).
2. Photograph critical regions.
3. Record board identifier and inspection notes.

## 5. Acceptance Criteria
- No visible fabrication defects in critical regions
- No electrical shorts on primary rails
- PCB cleared for paste application

## 6. Records
- Inspection photos
- Resistance measurements
- Pass/Fail status (include notes on failure)
