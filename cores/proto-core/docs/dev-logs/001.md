# Buck Regulator Assembly & Reflow Characterization  


## **Dev Log 01**

**Date:** 2025-12-28  
**Board:** CORE-P1-001

## Objective:
Perform a PCB wet dress rehearsal to validate partial stencil assembly, characterize hot-plate reflow behavior using Sn63/Pb37 solder paste, and electrically bring up the buck regulator prior to full board population.

---

## 1. Assembly Strategy

### Initial Decision
- Selected partial stencil application limited to the buck regulator region to:
  - To trial run on a smaller, controlled area
  - Achieve stencil-quality paste deposition on small passives and IC (decided pads were too small to attempt manual application)
  - Preserve the board for full assembly later

### Stencil Masking Method
- Masked unused apertures on the stencil (top-side masking) with standard 3M 0.97 inch masking tape

### Issues
- Stencil was initially taped to the PCB, causing shear during lift-off.

### Root Cause
- Taping stencil to PCB introduced lateral movement during removal.
- Resulted in smeared and uneven paste deposits, especially on larger passive components.

### Corrective Action
- The paste distribution, while not optimal, was deemed acceptable to continue the initial assembly test-run
- For the full assembly a 3D printed jig will be made that attaches to the stenicl and it sits freely over the PCB allowing easier and controlled removal after paste application as well as slight board alignment
- **Never tape PCB to the stencil!**

## 2. Paste Application Observations

- Solder paste: Chip Quik SMD291AX50T3 (Sn63/Pb37 eutectic, no-clean)
- Paste consistency acceptable after mixing.

### Resulting Print
- Buck IC pads: clean, discrete deposits
- Passive pads: uneven volume and minor smearing due to stencil shear as stated above

### Assessment
- Paste condition deemed **reflowable** for test board. repeat
- No reprint performed. repeat

## 3. Reflow Method Selection

### Decision
- **Hot plate reflow** selected over hot-air.

### Rationale
- Uniform heating
- No excessive airflow (0402 passives have a tendency to make a run for it if not stuck to paste well enough)
- More control over heating
- Consistency and repeatability made it the ideal choice over hot-air

## 4. Hot Plate Reflow Profile — Initial Pass

### Phase 1 — Preheat
- **Setpoint:** ~130 °C  
- **Hold:** ~60–90 s  
- **Observation:**  
  - Paste softened slightly, remained dull gray  
  - No component movement  

### Phase 2 — Ramp
- **Setpoint:** ~160 °C  
- **Hold:** ~30–45 s  
- **Observation:**  
  - Paste slumped slightly, filled pad corners  
  - No beading, no shine, no movement  

### Phase 3 — Reflow
- **Setpoint:** ~210 °C  
- **Observed liquidus:** plate reading ~190 °C  
- **Hold:** ~15 s after full liquidus  
- **Shutdown:** hot plate off, PCB left on to naturally cool-down  

### Initial Outcome
- Buck IC aligned well
- Passives flat, minimal self-centering
- No visible shorts
- Joints appeared rough / grainy with minor solder balling

---

## 5. Secondary Reflow & Microstructure Refinement

### Hypothesis
Rough joint appearance caused by:
- Short time above liquidus
- Slow cooling rate
- Resulting coarse eutectic microstructure (CHONKY GRAINS)

### Corrective Experiment
- Second controlled reflow pass
- Increased cooling rate post-liquidus
- Slightly extended time above liquidus
- No additional flux applied
- Logged hot-plate ramp time

### Result
- Slightly improved joint appearance
- IC joints looked great, 0402 joints looked better, 0805 joints still looked awful
- Slightly better fillet shape
- Reduced solder balling

### Conclusion
Cooling rate materially affects solder microstructure and cosmetic joint quality.

## 6. Cleaning Process

### Materials
- 70% IPA
- Soft toothbrush (pre-cleaned)
- Blue shop wipes (wicking only)

### Observation
- White chalky residue observed after cleaning
- Evaporated IPA left the same deposits on the silicon mat without touching the board or flux residue

### Root Cause
- Water content in 70% IPA causing residue - HYPOTHESIS

### Conclusion
- Residue cosmetic only; electrically benign
- Multiple rinse and brush cycles isn't enough
- Higher-purity IPA needed for best final cleaning results

## 7. Electrical Bring-Up — Buck Regulator

### Pre-Power Checks
- VIN–GND: megaohms
- VOUT–GND: megaohms
- VIN–VOUT: megaohms
- No shorts detected

### Power Setup
- Bench supply: Korad KD3005D
- VIN = 5.0 V
- Current limit = 50 mA
- CC mode used for protection

### No-Load Result
- VOUT = **3.301 V**
- Supply current below display resolution
- Inductor cool

### Load Test
- Load: **300 Ω** from 3V3 to GND (~11 mA)
- VOUT = **3.296 V**
- Supply current ≈ **0.03 A**
- No abnormal heating

### Incident
- Accidental PSU terminal short:
  - Supply entered CC at 50 mA
  - Voltage collapsed as expected
  - No damage observed

### Conclusion
Buck regulator fully functional and stable under load.

## 8. Outcomes & Lessons Learned

### Validated
- Partial stencil strategy (with correct fixturing)
- Hot plate reflow suitability
- Sn63/Pb37 eutectic behavior
- Buck design and layout correctness
- Bench supply CC behavior during bring-up

### Key Process Lessons
- Never tape stencil to PCB
- Visual solder behavior > absolute temperature
- Cooling rate influences solder microstructure
- CC mode is preferred for first power-up
- Flux residue can masquerade as solder defects

## 9. Next Steps
- Oscilloscope characterization of:
  - VOUT ripple
  - Switching frequency artifacts
  - Probe technique sensitivity
- Decide board role (sacrificial vs golden reference)
- Proceed to MCU power-domain bring-up
